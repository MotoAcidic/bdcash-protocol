Contributing to BDCASH
============================

The BDCASH Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing.

Firstly in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Core
developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally
revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors gain more trust from
the developer community. However, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
purposes. As such there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for
merging pull requests as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the
release cycle, overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.

Getting Started
---------------

New contributors are very welcome and needed.

Reviewing and testing is the most effective way you can contribute as a new
contributor, and it also will teach you much more about the code and process
than opening PRs. Please refer to the section [peer review](#peer-review) later
in this document.

Before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the BDCASH Core build
system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build
BDCASH Core and how to run the unit and functional tests.

### Good First Issue Label

The purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are
suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.

However, good first issues can be solved by anyone. If they remain unsolved
for a longer time, a frequent contributor might address them.

You do not need to request permission to start working on an issue. However,
you are encouraged to leave a comment if you are planning to work on it. This
will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed
and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.

Contributor Workflow
--------------------

The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone
without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests". This
facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

  1. Fork repository ([only for the first time](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo))
  1. Create topic branch
  1. Commit patches
